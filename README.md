# Scope

This will be a Minimal Viable Product containing the most important core content required.

 
#### Functional Specifications: 

* Image gallery to showcase work.
* Navigation – intuitive, easy to find what looking for.
* Contact form.
* Social Media links.

#### Content Requirements:

* Product information – Lamps, Wall Art, Garden.
* Info/history about the business.
* The art of stained glass making.
* Offer a Repair Service.
* Evening Classes.
 

#### Strategy/Scope Trade Off

Providing Evening Classes was not deemed to have high feasibility at this time given current public health advice around Covid-19 and so will not be included in the first release of the website.

# Structure

### Interaction Design: 

User interactions will be intuitive and allow for easy navigation throughout the site. For mobile devices this will use a combination 
of a collapsed navigation menu and buttons on the home page to encourage user interaction with the rest of the site. For larger devices a fixed top 
navigation menu will provide clear and easy access to all other pages.


### Information Design: 

Will allow for the prioritisation of the information to be displayed in a clear and concise manner to make it as easy as possible for the user 
to read and to quickly find the information that is most relevant to their needs.

# Skeleton

Wireframes for Mobile, Tablet & Desktop
 - [Home Page](https://github.com/Sharon-B/Judy-B-Stained-Glass/blob/master/assets/documentation/wireframes/home-wf.pdf)
 - [Lamps](https://github.com/Sharon-B/Judy-B-Stained-Glass/blob/master/assets/documentation/wireframes/lamps-wf.pdf)
 - [Wall Art](https://github.com/Sharon-B/Judy-B-Stained-Glass/blob/master/assets/documentation/wireframes/wallart-wf.pdf)
 - [Garden](https://github.com/Sharon-B/Judy-B-Stained-Glass/blob/master/assets/documentation/wireframes/garden-wf.pdf)
 - [Contact](https://github.com/Sharon-B/Judy-B-Stained-Glass/blob/master/assets/documentation/wireframes/contact-wf.pdf)

## Difference between final design and original wireframes:

#### Home page: 

On mobile devices the original wireframe had the buttons for navigating to the gallery pages on the image however during the build process it became apparent that this was distracting from the image itself and took away from the overall impact of the image.  It was decided to have the buttons at the bottom of each section instead. This way the buttons also serve as a divider between each section.

On all devices headings were added to each section of the home page to give the user a better understanding of the layout and to allow them to find relevant information more quickly.

On desktop devices it was decided to have the first image act as a hero image for the page to grab the users attention and give it full page width with a text paragraph under it. Also section dividers were added to distinguish between the different sections.

On tablets it was decided to use the same layout as for desktop as this is more visually appealing and allows for better flow. The user is also able to access the information more easily.

It was also decided to keep the social media icons in the centre of the footer for consistency across all devices on all pages.

#### Gallery Pages - Lamps, Wall Art and Garden:

A Contact Us button was added to the bottom of each of these pages across all devices as a call to action to encourage the user to get in touch. 

#### Contact Page:
A background image was added to the contact form to make it visually more interesting to the user. This also provides consistency across the entire site as all pages rely heavily on images.


# Surface

#### Typography:

Great Vibes is used for the main logo it’s cursive flowing style gives a creative and artistic feel to the site.

Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface used for the main text content that pairs well with Great Vibes.

#### Colour scheme: 

The colour scheme is based on the current branding of the company.

#### Images: 

Images are used throughout the site to show case the work created by Judy B Stained Glass and the products available.
