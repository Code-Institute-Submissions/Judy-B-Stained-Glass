# Scope

This will be a Minimal Viable Product containing the most important core content required.

 
#### Functional Specifications: 

* Image gallery to showcase work.
* Navigation – intuitive, easy to find what looking for.
* Contact form.
* Social Media links.

#### Content Requirements:

* Product information – Lamps, Wall Art, Garden.
* Info/history about the business.
* The art of stained glass making.
* Offer a Repair Service.
* Evening Classes.
 

#### Strategy/Scope Trade Off

Providing Evening Classes was not deemed to have high feasibility at this time given current public health advice around Covid-19 and 
so will not be included in the first release of the website.

# Structure

### Interaction Design: 

User interactions will be intuitive and allow for easy navigation throughout the site. For mobile devices this will use a combination 
of a collapsed fixed navbar and buttons on the home page to encourage user interaction with the rest of the site. For larger devices a fixed top 
navbar will provide clear and easy access to all other pages.


### Information Design: 

Will allow for the prioritisation of the information to be displayed in a clear and concise manner to make it as easy as possible for the user 
to read and to quickly find the information that is most relevant to their needs.

# Skeleton

Wireframes for Mobile

### Difference between final design and original wireframes:


# Surface
